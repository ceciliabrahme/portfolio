    <h3>The best things in life don’t happen on a screen</h3>
  <p>Our phones often makes our life better and easier. But more and more, phones work against us. It pulls you away from family, friends and even yourself.</p>
  <br><p class="quote text-center text-muted">Phones seem to steal time.</p><br>

  <p>From research we discovered a big user group with a real need: to reduce screen time.
    We decided to do something about it. We have created a new app to support a new type of wellness: Welcome to Life screen balance.</p>

    <p><b>The mission?</b> Inspire you to take the first step in putting down your phone and get back to real life.
    <br><br>

    </figure>
    <br>
    Just like the images above, the desired result is to enspire the user, help them become aware of their screen time and get the back to real life. Lets take a closer look at how we created the solution in a mobile app format. First off: Research.
      <br><br><p>
      <h3>Research / survey</h3>
We sent out a survey and got 89 replies. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaEL2A50aLHtLxu8hikPtRAm0WU-D05CRK2Wyt3YuAHVBGdQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&fbclid=IwAR0wqEmp8ukKmP8Bi3HoSQHdkGhPjzerJQngrOVam-03xSh5jkm-ql4V0xI">You can find the survey here.</a>

      <br><br>The result? 66% touches their phone every 15 min or more and many feels bad, shame, headache, stress, “way too addicted”.<br><br>76% touches it more now during the global lockdown (Spring 2020). Most people reveal that they are encouraged by getting positive information as a method for change.<br><br>Key question: What bothers you the most about your screen time? It turns out that sleep, productivity and freetime is the main critical areas. You can see the full research in this

      <br><br>

<h3>Research / interviews</h3>
      <p>Job-to-be-done interviews showed that users' goals is to have a better feeling about the way they interact with their phones, give them a feeling that they spend the time well and not wasting time.
      <br><br>Give them a feeling that they enjoy life to the fullest, not held back by addiction to phone. They want to feel empowered, learn, grow and feel that they make own decision about behaviour.
      </p>

      <br><br>

          <h3>User persona</h3>

          The research allowed us to create a user persona, please let me introduce Sara below:

          <h3 class="text-center">Problem Statement</h3>
          <br>
          <p class="text-center"><i>Sara, an artsy big city girl, needs a solution to help her reduce screen time and reconnect to real life. She wants to be more in her creative flow, and challenge herself to be more productive.
        </i></p>

<br><br>
            <h2>The solution</h2>
          <br>  The solution is Balanced. An app to help you reduce screen time. Let's have a look at how – below are the main features.
            <br><br><b>Statistics:</b> measure longest pick up of the day, how much she checks her time while working, the longest time she leaves the screen locked, and also the time on social media, her emails, or text messages.
            <br><br><b>Phone detox:</b> Switch off phone with thanks to the Flip function, set up sleep time, set up her first time to take her phone in the morning or at night. And slow scrolling function.
            <br><br><b>Motivational messages:</b> Encourage users with motivational messages like: “You have scrolled 21km, it’s almost a half-marathon! What if you went out to run for real?”
            <br><br><b>Dopamine boost:</b> Get ideas for free times by personalizing preferences feature and send recommendations according to hobbies and goals next to users.
            <br><br><b>Challenges:</b> Celebrate life’s mindful moments, big and small, and create challenges between people, family, and friends.

              <br><br>

              <p>Below is a sitemap to better understand how the features above are placed into a logical information architecture.</p>

              <h3>Designing a solution</h3>

              Ideation sessions with Round Robin (drawing ideas on a piece of paper and passing it on to the next person) was put into place. First sketches, then mid-fi wireframes to have a solid foundation.

                <h3>Mid-fi prototype</h3>
                <p>Here's the full mid-fi prototype. Based on this protoype 20 usability tests were conducted. The idea is to show users to a black and white version were focus can be on the userflow and not yet on feeling, colors and mood. </p>

                <p>Mid-fi screens were a magic foundation to fast jump into hi-fi. I'm giving a glimps below in the GIF of how tihs process looked.</p>

<h3>Creating an identity</h3
<p>Now comes the polishing – we need to make Balanced look just that: balanced. But also choose colors and style to be in line with the chosen brand values.
<br><br>
  Brand values: Inspiring, Calming, Insightful, Friendly. <br><br>Let's come back to the moodboard below:</p>

  <br><br>
<h3>Moodboard</h3>

  <br>

<br>
<h3>The logo and name</h3>
<p>During the inspiration phase the logotype emerged. It’s a symbol looking like a real balance, but can also be seen a the letter ‘b’ laying down horizontally – or the symbol of putting down your phone.
</p>
<br>

</div>

<br><br>
<h3>Style tile</h3>
<p>To bring a feeling of something calm and relaxing, we created a shade of light blue for the background. And to play with contrasts, our primary colors are solid with dark grey and light orange.
To feel more light and flat, all our icons are designed with outlines at 2.6pt, and our buttons are rounded at 5pt.</p>

<h3>Screens</h3>
<p>Let's zoom in on the screens for each section: onboarding, homepage, statistics and detox.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Desirability testing</h3>
<p>The desirability was done with 16 users. The idea? Users got to see the prototype and was then asked to say with 5 words they think about. <br><br>Below you can see the brand values to the left and the result from the desirability testing to the right. Some words like friendly and imaginative can be seen in both our values and the users' values. Overall the words are a lot in line with what Balanced wants to be.

<br><br>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>More user testing! This project was done in 4 days for the UX part and 4 days for the UI. I'd like to spend another 40 or 400 days making things pixle perfect and making sure the usability is great. Iteration is a continious process.<br><br>
   One of the main priorities is to play even more with contrasts: make sure screens are clean and easy to read, also for the font, and how the information is organized.
<br><br>Measure usage would give very useful information on what users like with Balanced. Are they mainly looking for inspiration? Or do they like the Detox action features like the slow scrolling?

<br><br><Next step is also to create a real rewards system and I look forward to evolve the application and look into partnerships for the rewards. How can we encourage users to reduce screen time and make them feel like they win?
A free coffee at Starbucks or some extra euros in your pocket for spending a Sunday off screen, that would be pretty cool right? Stay tuned friends!
