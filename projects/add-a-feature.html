<h3>The best things in life don’t happen on a screen</h3>
<p>

Uber, next generation car services? Please allow me to reintroduce this title:
Uber, next generation cat services.

Research reveals a ride share battle
Uber is running a tough competition and loosing market shares in one of its most important cities:
San Francisco.
There’s a clear ride share battle out there. And the major competitor is called Lyft.

Uber is loosing market shares in San Francisco against the competitor Lyft
I decided to zoom in closer on this problem.
Positioning
Before finding a solution, let’s take a look at how these two brands are positioned.
Looking at the positioning map below, you can see that Uber is perceived as a high quality brand, whereas Lyft is not far behind in terms of quality but has way higher brand equity.

Ubers current position and desired position
Finding a solution to the problem
So now what? I went on a mission to do something about it.
My idea of Uber is that it’s a very bold and daring company, but perhaps not perceived as the most friendly and fun one. I started to brainstorm different ways to change this perception. In the back of my mind I had Uber’s brand values and mission.
Uber’s mission: Igniting opportunities by setting the world in motion.
The goal
The goal was to come up with a funny idea that’s out of the box, something new, something fun which will make consumers rediscover Uber and have it as their top of mind next time they unconsciously choose which app to order a car.
The idea is to introduce a brand new service for Uber, to create a buzz in San Francisco and win new market shares.
Introducing Uber Pets
Let me introduce Uber Pets. Order Kittens and Puppies cats and dogs out of the bag — delivered to your living room or office.

Get a little fluffy friend for a few hours to cuddle and play. Just open your app and click on Uber Pets to start browsing cute cats and dogs.
Get a puppy to your office during a creative afternoon workshop
Get a dog for your Sunday run in the park
Order a cat for your lonely grandma
Surprise a friend with a kitten for her birthday

Uber pets allows you to order Kittens and Puppies cats and dogs out of the bag — delivered to your living room or office.
How will this work?
The idea is to work with shelter dogs and cats, to help service dogs train, before they later in life will serve duty (as a dog for blind people for example). By helping them seeing humans in the meanwhile, they will gain experience and feel closeness — feel better than being isolated in a shelter.

The benefits for humans
And for humans, of course, the idea is to make lonely people feel less lonely — and create a cosy, fun, exciting experience for Uber users. It could be a great idea for a birthday surprise or Sunday activity.
To get to know more about what users really would think I conducted 8 different user interviews.
User research
In my interviews I found a common positive approach. Users actually love the idea. But the animals are important for users, and the way Uber treats them and animals rights need to be highlighted in the app. Below is a summary of the takeouts.

Users would like to know the activity level of the animal, their fur, where they come from and if they have specific characteristics in general.


Generating ideas
After having validated the new idea I gathered up with two fellow designers to let our creativity flow. We did a Crazy 8 round to generate ideas. It also helped me get feedback on my own ideas for the new Uber Pets feature and prioritize.
I continued sketching my screens on paper. As I did this I had to have Ubers current design in mind. As I build the user flow it has to be perfectly aligned with how Uber would do it.

The idea was to stay simple in line with Uber and ‘fast and bold’ values, but yet introduce a tone of voice that’s friendly and in line with the new Pets idea.
Below is the user flow.

From the user flow I created a mid-fi prototype.

As it was time to move on with the hi-fi prototype, I took Ubers current design system into consideration.

Uber has a well defined design system that I took into consideration
Finally things got real, the first screens in hi-fi are right below.

Usability testing
I tested this prototype with 4 users. I got a lot of feedback regarding the information, users want to know more and being able to filter dogs, add more tags.
Users also mentioned that they want to have the possibility to adopt pets, and take it to the next level.

A summary of the user testing
Success metrics
The following three areas are important to follow the evolution after the feature launch.
How are animals feeling? (Important for users)
How are users reacting? (Important for Uber)
Whats the buzz? Market share? (Important for Uber)
To wrap up, I understood the following during the user tests:

What’s next?
Next steps
UI: identity and color? More warmth?
Animations and descriptions: photos of different pet shelters, videos
Insurance communication: change placement, ease commitment feeling
Feature wish list: New tags, tag search feature, my favorites
Step by step, iteration by iteration. Hide your keyboards, hide your mice. Uber pets could get their paws into your door tomorrow.</p>
